A wizard wielding this tome could indeed, within seconds, precisely deduce how many individual grains of sand were on a planet. This tome alone is touted as the grandfather of the modern Wizard Federation, and certainly is responsible for your gem-encrusted hardsuits and your emerald-plated vessel. Your operations will, through the power of this stony grimoire, surely proceed smooth as slate and clear as crystal. That.. being said... It would appear that some, okay well, MOST of the pages have been ripped out of this copy. Through your wizardly intellect however, you deduce that missing pages will not lessen it's power.
